# Professional Portfolio

## Why make a portfolio?
I am making this portfolio to give anyone(recruiters, co-workers, colleauges,
 or even just friends) a chance to delve into my code; this ultimately allows
 them to view how I have grown as a developer.

## Is this portfolio hosted anywhere?
**Yes!** This repo is hosted online at: www.coltonmarschik.com

## Is this portfolio complete?
**No!** This portfolio will continually improve and expand with my ever-growing
 knowledge-base.
